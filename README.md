# DCIT318 Assignment 2

## Description

This repository contains a C# console application demonstrating various aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#. The project is divided into three parts:

1. **Inheritance and Method Overriding**: Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding using a base class `Animal` and derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`.
2. **Abstract Classes and Methods**: Demonstrates abstract classes and methods using an abstract class `Shape` and derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
3. **Interfaces**: Demonstrates the use of interfaces with an `IMovable` interface and implementing classes `Car` and `Bicycle`.

## Repository Structure

- `InheritanceAndMethodOverriding/`: Contains the implementation for inheritance and method overriding.
- `AbstractClassesAndMethods/`: Contains the implementation for abstract classes and methods.
- `Interfaces/`: Contains the implementation for interfaces.
